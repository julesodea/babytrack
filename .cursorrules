# Commit Message Rules

Follow the Conventional Commits standard.

All commit messages must start with one of:

- feat: for new features
- fix: for bug fixes
- refactor: for code refactoring without behavior changes
- docs: for documentation changes
- style: for formatting changes only
- test: for tests
- chore: for maintenance tasks

Format:

<type>: <short description>

Examples:
feat: add map marker clustering
fix: correct distance calculation bug
refactor: simplify sidebar state logic

Keep descriptions under 72 characters.
Use present tense.
Do not capitalize the first letter unless necessary.
